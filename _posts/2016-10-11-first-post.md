So... this is my first post.

A little bit about myself. I have a wide and varied set of interests. They mainly revolve around technology, but sometimes can go into Politics and Public Policy and sometimes can be something entirely different.

I intend to write about Data Science. Python is my copilot. I'm fascinated by the Analytics and Machine Learning world and the amazing people that are in it. Although I have struggle to acknowledge it, there is a moment in a man's life when you need to assume that you are one big nerd. I love videogames and I've built several gaming PCs. One of the best presents I've given myself was to build a Linux Home Server.

I will try to write often, although everybody says that and very few manage to do so. Some of my blog posts will be in English, some in Spanish. It will vary upon subject and audience.

I hope you enjoy. Please leave comments. I like feedback.
